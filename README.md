# Learning CNNs using Fashion-MNIST

This assignment will bulld CNNS using the Fashion-MINST dataset. In particular, we will use MNIST Fashion to study CNN architectures and parameters.

This assignment focuses on how to classify fashion_mnist data with a simple Convolutional Neural Network in Keras. Keras is part of the core TensorFlow library, in addition to being an independent open source project.

# Task : Architecture Comparison

We have a baseline code and now want to compare other different architectures.

Must run 10 additional architectures:

-2 different combination of number of filters 

-2 different combinations of kernels for (convolution, pooling)

-2 different dropout probability values 

-1 new architecture with more layers 

-3 experiments with combined changes 

Report the results in a table with the first column describing the architecture and the second column the predictive accuracy of the model on the data.
